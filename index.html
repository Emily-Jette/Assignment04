    <p class="conclusion">Annie Easley was a hard working, kind, and intelligent person.<q>My head is not in the sand. But my thing is, if I can’t work with you, I will work around you. I was not about to be [so] discouraged that I’d walk away. That may be a solution for some people, but it’s not mine.</q></p>
