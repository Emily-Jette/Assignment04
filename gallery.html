    <p class="quote"> When talking about intollerent people, she said,<q>When people have their biases and prejudeces, yes I am aware.My head is not in the sand. But my thing is, if I can’t work with you, I will work around you. I was not about to be so discouraged that I’d walk away. That may be a solution for some people, but it’s not mine.</q></p>

    <p class="quote"> Annie recalled something her mother said to her and that she strongly believes, <q>You can be anything you want to. It doesn't matter what you look like, what your size is, what your colour is.</q></p>

    <p class="quote"> Being born in the South as a Africian American, Annie faced countless amounts of racism and had to constantly fight for her right to be heard. <q>Nothing was given to minorities or women. It took some fighting to get that equal opportunity, and we're still fighting today.</q></p>
